# Mars Daily Report: US Senate Passes "Big Beautiful" Bill, Arizona Governor Veto Bitcoin Reserve Bill HB2324

## Ethereum Community Foundation Launched to Drive ETH Value Growth

The Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF) has officially launched with a mission to accelerate institutional adoption of Ethereum infrastructure while strategically boosting ETH's value. According to Ethereum core developer Zak Cole's announcement on X, this new organization has already secured millions in ETH donations to fund "trustless neutral" technological development. ECF's website emphasizes: "All supported integrations must facilitate ETH burning. This aligns institutional usage with ETH holder value. By prioritizing supply-reducing mechanisms, we strengthen Ethereum's monetary integrity."

Key requirements for funded projects:
1. **Immutability**: Permanent, unchangeable code execution
2. **Tokenless Architecture**: No additional governance or utility tokens

The foundation prioritizes real-world asset (RWA) blockchain applications (stocks, bonds, real estate) and public goods initiatives addressing data availability pricing imbalances. Through transparent community voting, ECF will allocate funds to projects like the newly established Ethereum Validator Association (EVA), which empowers validators to influence protocol development using staked ETH.
