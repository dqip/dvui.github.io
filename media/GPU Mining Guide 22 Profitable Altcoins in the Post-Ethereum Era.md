## Frequently Asked Questions  

### Q1: How does Ethereum's merge affect GPU mining economics?  
The removal of Ethereum from the GPU mining market caused a 65% decrease in GPU demand, creating favorable conditions for altcoin mining. Miners can now access previously Ethereum-dominated hardware at reduced prices.  

### Q2: Which coins offer the best risk-reward ratio?  
Flux and Kadena currently show the most stable profitability curves. Their hybrid models and dApp ecosystems provide long-term growth potential.  

### Q3: How often should miners switch between coins?  
Monitoring profitability daily is recommended. However, frequent switching (more than weekly) may reduce overall efficiency due to setup time and network latency.  

### Q4: What's the impact of electricity costs on profitability?  
At $0.10/kWh, miners need at least $0.20 daily returns to break even. Lower electricity costs (<$0.06/kWh) make most coins profitable even during bear markets.  

### Q5: Are cloud mining contracts viable alternatives?  
For small-scale operations, owning physical hardware remains more profitable. Cloud mining works best for institutional investors seeking instant scale.
