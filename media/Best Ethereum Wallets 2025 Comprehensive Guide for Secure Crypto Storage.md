## Understanding Ethereum Wallets  

### What Is an Ethereum Wallet?  

An Ethereum wallet stores public and private keys to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Public keys act as your wallet address for receiving funds, while private keys authorize transactions. Wallets can be categorized as:

2. **Cold Wallets:** Offline storage (e.g., hardware wallets, paper wallets).  

Security remains paramount. Always prioritize wallets offering:  
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)  
- Regular backup options  
- Open-source code for transparency
