The service, initially supporting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), received regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This move positions Standard Chartered as a key player in the Middle East's rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem.

## Competitive Landscape  

Standard Chartered joins a growing list of traditional financial institutions entering the crypto custody space:  
- **HSBC**: Offers crypto custody in Europe and Asia through its HSBC Orion platform  
- **BNY Mellon**: Provides institutional-grade custody for BTC and ETH since 2022

The UAEâ€™s crypto custodial market is projected to grow at 23% CAGR through 2030, driven by increasing tokenization of traditional assets and blockchain-based financial products.  

### Security Architecture Breakdown  

Standard Charteredâ€™s custody solution incorporates:  
1. **Multi-signature wallet technology**: Requires multiple approvals for transactions

- Regular third-party security audits  
- Real-time transaction reporting to regulators  
- Customer due diligence (CDD) protocols exceeding FATF standards  

### Future Outlook  

Standard Charteredâ€™s Middle East expansion aligns with its 2025-2030 strategic plan, which includes:  
- Launching tokenized securities platforms by Q3 2025
