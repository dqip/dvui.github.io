### Biometric Authentication

Facial recognition technology has significantly improved verification accuracy. The process involves:

1. Positioning device camera in well-lit environment
2. Following on-screen prompts for head movements
3. Maintaining neutral facial expression during capture
4. System cross-referencing with submitted documents

Verification typically completes within 15-30 minutes during peak hours. Critical factors affecting processing time include document clarity and system workload.
