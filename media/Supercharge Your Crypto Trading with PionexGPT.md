## Exploring the GPT Marketplace  
The GPT Marketplace is a hub for discovering and adopting proven strategies. Key features include:  
- **Pre-Built Strategies**: Filter by asset class, risk level, or profitability metrics.  
- **Performance Analytics**: View backtested results, including Sharpe ratio and profit factor.  
- **Community Insights**: Learn from top traders' methodologies.  

For example, a strategy designed for **leverage trading** in altcoins might showcase a 200% annual return, but users must assess its drawdown history before copying.  

## Following and Copying Strategies  
Copying strategies is ideal for beginners or time-constrained traders. Steps include:  
1. **Select a Strategy**: Choose based on risk profile and historical performance.  
2. **Allocate Capital**: Set investment limits to align with your risk management plan.  
3. **Monitor Performance**: Adjust allocations or exit underperforming strategies.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution**: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Always diversify copied strategies.  

## Understanding Leverage and Risk Management  
Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Pionex offers up to 100x leverage on select pairs, but effective risk management is critical:  

### Key Risk Mitigation Techniques  
- **Position Sizing**: Allocate 1-5% of your portfolio per trade.  
- **Stop-Loss Orders**: Automatically exit positions at predefined loss thresholds.  
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Spread investments across assets and strategies.  

For instance, a trader using 10x leverage on a BTC/USDT position should pair it with a stop-loss to limit downside risk.  

## The Importance of Google Authenticator  
Security is paramount in crypto trading. Pionex mandates **Google Authenticator** for two-factor authentication (2FA), adding a layer of protection against unauthorized access. Steps to enable:  
1. Download Google Authenticator from your app store.  
2. Scan the QR code provided by Pionex.  
3. Enter the generated code to complete setup.  

This measure safeguards your funds and trading history from phishing attacks or account breaches.  

## Monitoring and Evaluating Bot Performance  
Regularly assess your bot's health using these metrics:  

| Metric | Ideal Value |  
|--------|-------------|  
| Profitability | Positive over 30+ days |  
| Max Drawdown | <20% of portfolio |  
| Win Rate | >50% for conservative strategies |  

Adjust parameters quarterly or during significant market shifts. For example, a strategy optimized for sideways markets may underperform during a breakout.
