# Coinbase Pro Adds 0x (ZRX) Token Ahead of Mass Rollout  

The integration of 0x (ZRX) into Coinbase Pro‚Äôs ecosystem marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency accessibility. This article explores the technical, strategic, and market implications of Coinbase Pro‚Äôs decision to list ZRX, its impact on traders, and the broader crypto landscape.  

## Coinbase Pro ZRX Integration Timeline  

In October 2018, Coinbase Pro announced it would list ZRX, a native token of the 0x decentralized exchange protocol. This move surprised industry observers, as Coinbase had previously acquired Paradex‚Äîa decentralized exchange (DEX) competitor‚Äîearlier that year. Key milestones include:  

- **Deposits Enabled**: Coinbase Pro users could deposit ZRX tokens ahead of trading activation.  
- **Trading Activation**: Trading pairs (ZRX/USD, ZRX/BTC, ZRX/EUR) entered ‚Äútransfer-only mode‚Äù for at least 12 hours before full liquidity was achieved.  
- **Mass Rollout**: ZRX became available on Coinbase‚Äôs main platform and mobile apps after its Pro launch.

## Strategic Shift in Coinbase‚Äôs Listing Policy  

Coinbase‚Äôs decision to list ZRX directly‚Äîinstead of through its Paradex acquisition‚Äîsignals a strategic pivot toward broader asset support. Key changes in Coinbase‚Äôs approach include:  

- **Open Application Process**: Developers can now apply for token listings, mirroring Binance‚Äôs model.  
- **Standardized Criteria**: Assets must meet Coinbase‚Äôs undisclosed ‚Äústandards‚Äù for security, compliance, and liquidity.  
- **Focus on Decentralized Protocols**: ZRX‚Äôs integration aligns with Coinbase‚Äôs interest in DeFi infrastructure.  

This shift contrasts with Coinbase‚Äôs earlier reluctance to diversify its order book, reflecting evolving market demands and regulatory clarity.  

## Technical Overview of 0x (ZRX)  

0x is an open-source protocol enabling decentralized token exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain. Its core features include:  

- **Off-Chain Order Relaying**: Reduces congestion by handling order books off-chain while settling trades on-chain.  
- **Interoperability**: Powers third-party DEXs and DeFi applications (dApps) like Paradex.

The listing of ZRX on Coinbase Pro underscores growing institutional confidence in Ethereum-based DeFi solutions.
