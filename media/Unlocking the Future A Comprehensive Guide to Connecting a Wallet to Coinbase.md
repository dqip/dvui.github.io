## Understanding Cryptocurrency Wallets  

A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital tool that stores, sends, and receives cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional wallets, these tools manage cryptographic keysâ€”private and publicâ€”that authenticate transactions. Wallets fall into two main categories:  

### Hot Wallets vs. Cold Wallets  
| **Feature**          | **Hot Wallets**                          | **Cold Wallets**                        |  
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| **Security**          | Lower (connected to the internet)        | Higher (offline storage)                |  
| **Convenience**       | High (easy access for frequent trades)   | Low (ideal for long-term storage)       |  
| **Examples**          | MetaMask, Trust Wallet                   | Ledger, Trezor, Paper Wallets           |  

**Software Wallets**: Desktop, mobile, or web-based apps offering quick access. Popular options include **Coinbase Wallet** and **Exodus**.  
**Hardware Wallets**: Physical devices like **Ledger Nano X** or **Trezor Model T** that store keys offline, reducing hacking risks.  
**Paper Wallets**: Printouts of keys and QR codes, offering maximum security but limited usability.
