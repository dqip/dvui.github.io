## Understanding Shiba Inu Coin: More Than a Meme  

While often dismissed as a novelty, Shiba Inu Coin has evolved beyond its origins. The project includes a decentralized ecosystem with **ShibaSwap**, a decentralized exchange (DEX) enabling users to trade tokens, stake liquidity, and earn rewards. This infrastructure adds utility to SHIB, differentiating it from purely speculative assets.  

### Market Dynamics and Investor Behavior  
- **Volatility**: SHIBâ€™s price surged 100% in seven days, reflecting the high-risk, high-reward nature of meme coins.  
- **Community-Driven Growth**: Retail investors, organized on platforms like Reddit and Twitter, have fueled SHIBâ€™s adoption, mirroring the GameStop rally of 2021.  
- **Comparison to Dogecoin**: While both feature dog-themed mascots, SHIBâ€™s deflationary model and ecosystem development offer unique value propositions.

### Robinhoodâ€™s Stance on New Listings
