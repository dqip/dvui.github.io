## Who Qualifies for the zkSync Airdrop?

The distribution mechanism prioritizes genuine ecosystem participants through two distinct categories:

### 1. Active Users (89% of Airdrop Pool)
- **Eligibility Criteria**: Wallets demonstrating meaningful interaction with zkSync Era and Lite networks before the March 24 snapshot
- **Activity Threshold**: Minimum of one qualifying transaction (e.g., swaps, NFT mints, DeFi interactions)
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Transaction volume
  - Holding periods for zkSync-native assets
  - DeFi participation depth

### 2. Ecosystem Contributors (11% of Airdrop Pool)
This category rewards those shaping the zkSync ecosystem beyond transactional activity:
- **Protocol Developers**: Core protocol contributors and tooling developers
- **Security Researchers**: Participants in Cantina, Code 4 rena, and CodeHawks audit competitions
- **Community Builders**: Moderators, translators (ZK Credo), and ZK Quest participants
- **Infrastructure Providers**: DeFi protocol developers and ZK chain operators

## Airdrop Distribution Mechanics

### Multiplier System Enhancements
Qualifying addresses receive bonus multipliers for demonstrating authentic human behavior:
1. **NFT Holders**: 1.5x multiplier for owning zkSync-native NFTs
2. **ERC-20 Supporters**: 1.2x for holding zkSync-native tokens
3. **Account Abstraction**: 2x for using smart contract wallets
4. **Community Engagement**: 1.8x for prior ETH ecosystem airdrop recipients

### Allocation Formula
The mathematical model considers multiple factors:
```
Allocation = (Total Assets on zkSync Ã— 0.4) + 
             (DeFi TVL Contribution Ã— 0.3) + 
             (Network Participation Score Ã— 0.3)
```

### Minimum and Maximum Thresholds
- **Minimum Claim**: 450 ZK tokens (smaller balances get redistributed)
- **Maximum Cap**: 100,000 ZK tokens per address
- **Recovery Pool**: Unclaimed tokens from sub-450 balances

## Advanced Sybil Detection System

zkSync implemented sophisticated anti-gaming measures:
1. **Behavioral Analysis**: Tracking wallet interaction patterns
2. **Temporal Metrics**: Evaluating long-term asset retention
3. **Network Effects**: Measuring DApp integration depth

Over 6 million unique addresses were analyzed, with Sybil detection eliminating 85% of potential fake accounts. The system prioritizes wallets showing:
- Organic DeFi participation
- Cross-protocol interactions
- Consistent transaction patterns

## FAQ: ZK Token Airdrop

**Q: Can I combine multiple addresses for airdrop eligibility?**  
A: No, each wallet is evaluated independently. However, maintaining multiple active addresses increases overall participation score.

**Q: What happens to unclaimed tokens?**  
A: Unclaimed tokens will be redistributed to active participants or allocated to future ecosystem development initiatives.

**Q: How are DeFi activities measured?**  
A: Both liquidity provision duration and transaction volume across zkSync-native protocols contribute to the DeFi participation score.

**Q: Are testnet activities considered?**  
A: Only mainnet transactions on zkSync Era and Lite networks qualify for the airdrop.

**Q: What defines "meaningful interaction"?**  
A: The system evaluates transaction diversity, frequency, and value retention rather than raw transaction count.

**Q: Can I delegate my voting power?**  
A: Yes, the token enables governance participation through direct voting or delegation to community representatives.

## Strategic Implications

This airdrop establishes zkSync as a pioneer in community-centric tokenomics. By rewarding both usage and contribution, the protocol creates a balanced ecosystem where developers and users share in the network's success. The 67% community allocation sets a new standard for decentralized governance, while the sophisticated Sybil detection system enhances security for future airdrops.
