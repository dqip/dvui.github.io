Cryptocurrency futures trading has become a cornerstone of modern digital asset investment strategies. This guide provides a structured approach to navigating OKX's futures platform, covering essential mechanics, risk management principles, and strategic execution techniques.  

## Understanding Futures Contracts  

Futures trading allows investors to speculate on price movements without owning underlying assets. OKX offers three contract types:  
1. **Weekly Contracts**: Expire on the nearest Friday  
2. **Bi-Weekly Contracts**: Expire on the second Friday from trade date  
3. **Quarterly Contracts**: Expire on the last Friday of March, June, September, or December

## Step-by-Step Trading Process  

### 1. Market Analysis & Position Selection  
Successful trading begins with technical and fundamental analysis. Determine your position (long/short) based on:  
- Price action patterns  
- Market sentiment indicators  
- Macro-economic factors affecting crypto markets  

### 2. Leverage & Margin Management  
Two margin modes are available:  
| **Margin Mode** | **Key Features** | **Risk Profile** |  
|------------------|------------------|------------------|  
| Full Margin | Consolidates account risk/rewards | Higher systemic risk |  
| Isolated Margin | Separate margin per position | Controlled position risk |  

Calculate required margin using:  
`Margin = Contract Value / Leverage`  

### 3. Order Execution  
Choose between:  
- **Limit Orders**: Set specific entry/exit prices  
- **Market Orders**: Execute immediately at best available price  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Margin requirements trigger liquidation when account equity falls below:  
- 10% of margin (10x leverage)  
- 20% of margin (20x leverage)  

## Contract Lifecycle Management  

### Position Monitoring  
Track real-time P&L through:  
- Dynamic margin adjustments  
- Stop-loss/take-profit orders  
- Portfolio diversification across contract types  

### Risk Control Mechanisms  
Implement these safeguards:  
1. **Position Sizing**: Never risk more than 2-5% of account equity per trade  
2. **Leverage Optimization**: Use 5-10x for conservative strategies, 15-20x for aggressive plays  
3. **Time Horizon Alignment**: Match contract expiration dates with market outlook

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q1: How do I calculate liquidation prices?**  
A: Use OKX's liquidation calculator by inputting:  
- Current price  
- Leverage level  
- Entry price  
- Position size  

**Q2: What happens during forced liquidation?**  
A: Positions get automatically closed when margin falls below required thresholds. System recovers losses from the insurance fund, distributing costs proportionally among profitable accounts.  

**Q3: Can I change margin modes after opening positions?**  
A: Yes, but only when all positions have 0 margin. Always convert during market downtime to avoid execution risks.  

**Q4: How are settlement prices determined?**  
A: Based on the final index price calculated from a 30-minute TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) before expiration.  

**Q5: What's the minimum contract size?**  
A: Varies by cryptocurrency. BTC contracts start at 0.001 BTC, ETH at 0.01 ETH.  

**Q6: How do funding rates work?**  
A: Periodic payments between long/short positions calculated hourly. Positive rates indicate bullish bias, negative rates bearish sentiment.  

## Advanced Risk Mitigation  

Implement these professional techniques:  
1. **Scenario Analysis**: Stress-test portfolios against 20%/30%/50% price swings  
2. **Hedging Ratios**: Calculate optimal hedge using beta coefficients  
3. **Liquidity Management**: Maintain 20-30% cash reserves for margin calls
